To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I learned how to control images using background-image. Refreshed my knowledge regarding @media for responsive design. Still there are points where I was stuck to create the layout. So, I will keep upskill and try to optimize a bit more in the future.
